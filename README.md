# Stop Word Removal

 Stop word removal is one of the most commonly used preprocessing steps across different NLP applications. The idea is simply removing the words that occur commonly across all the documents in the corpus. Typically, articles and pronouns are generally classified as stop words. However, for morphologically rich languages such as Malayalam, stop word  varies based on the application. The system automatically removes the stop words from the Malayalam document .In the module,the input is tokenized and searches and removes the stopwords from the tokenized list.
